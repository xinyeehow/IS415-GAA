## About me

My name is Xinyee, and I'm a year 3 student in SMU majoring in Information Systems. I am also specialising in Business Analytics.

As an avid foodie, I go around different parts of Singapore and even overseas like Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia to look for good food.
